div.bold-text {font-weight: 700;}
selector        property     value

<div> is an empty container and one of the basic html elements

----SELECTORS----
universal selector: *
*{color:purple;}
will select elements of any type

type selector
div {color:purple;}
all the <div> elements would be selected and styled purple

class selector
html <div class="subani">
css: .subani {color:purple}
will only select the class subani
classes can be used on as many elements as we want
multiple classes: can be added by using space class="student subani" where student is a class and subani is another class

id selector
html <div id="subani">
css: #subani {color:purple;}
elements can have only one id, cannot be repeated
should be used sparingly

grouping selectors
if two classes share some same properties then to avoid repetition we can...
.subani, .malla {color:red;}

chaining selectors
for the multiple class we could chain by .student.subani {}
can also be done for id and class   .student#subani{}

descendant selectors 
<div class="A"> 
 <div class = "b"> 
 </div> 
</div>
then we can select it like this .A .b
by using a single space between the selectors


----PROPERTIES----
color background-color
font-family: "Times New Roman", sans-serif; it wil use tnr if its available otherwise sans serif which is a general one
font-size, font-weight: this can be bold or a number between 1-1000, text-align

if we wanna adjust the image size then use height: auto and width: as much as you want

----ADDING CSS TO HTML-----
<head><link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" </head>
